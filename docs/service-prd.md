## üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD) - TMT Microservice

---

### üìå Overview
The TMT (Test Management Tool) microservice is designed to manage the lifecycle of assessments, including test creation, question management, test taking, scoring, and result reporting. This microservice will be integrated as part of a distributed system and will receive user context and access rights via JWT headers from an upstream API gateway.

---

### üéØ Objectives
- Provide a robust backend for managing test content and test-taking workflows.
- Support both objective and subjective question types.
- Enable dynamic test composition using configurable rules.
- Facilitate proctoring via photo capture and reviewer-based evaluation.
- Ensure security and access control using JWT-based authentication.

### üîê Authentication & Access Control
- All requests will be authenticated using JWT headers.
- JWT will include claims like `user_id`, `role`, and `company_id`.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced at route/method level.
