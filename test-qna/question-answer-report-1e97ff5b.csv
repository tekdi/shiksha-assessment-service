Make memory for a lifetime that go last (yea come on baby)
Knock a glass with two ice, she doh catch feelings she catch flights
So she coming back to the sunshine paradise (Lorraine, wha yuh say?)
Lorraine say it cold out in New York City
Say she coming home 'cause she mas have to play
Lorraine say it cold out in New York City
Say she coming home 'cause she mas have to play
","Everywhere she go, watch she wine and rollin'
Every video that in she phone, is she wine and rollin'
All over the road, watch she wine and rollin'
When the rhythm hit in she soul, watch she wine and rollin'
She come for a good time, say a prayer and she outside
Because the season come so fast, oh yeah
And for the ones cya be here, raise your glasses in the air
Celebrate for the present not the past (Lorraine wha yuh say)","N/A","Lost in emotion, mama's youngest
Tryna navigate life without my compass
Some experience death and feel numbness
But not me, I felt it all and couldn't function
Seein' you that day
Tellin' you my plans but I was leavin' you that day
It was in God's hands, Ye was at Elon's waiting to get with me
On my way to Texas, that's when Virginia hit me
And I realized in that instant
Our last conversation, you was against it
Told you I was going to Turks for Thanksgiving
I heard what I wanted to hear but didn't listen
You said you told Gene that Bup needed forgiveness
I see you went to DD's and stuffed both her fridges
You even told Dad you wished y'all never splitted
See, you were checkin' boxes, I was checkin' my mentions
Sayin' you was tired but not ready to go
Basically was dying without lettin' me know
I loved you met Nige, hate that he won't remember you
Two things that break my heart is what Novembers do
And T follows you, now mind you
DD calls you, Gene finds you, was that your vision?
Precision, while I'm reminiscin'
It all hits different
Ma, listen
The birds don't sing (yeah)
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain, pain
The birds don't sing (oh)
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (oh, they screech in pain)
The birds don't sing
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain
Your car was in the driveway, I knew you were home
By the third knock, a chill ran through my bones
The way you missed Mama, I guess I should've known
Chivalry ain't dead, you ain't let her go alone
Found you in the kitchen, scriptures in the den
Half-written texts that you never got to send
Combin' through your dresser drawer, where do I begin?
Postin' noted Bible quotes, were you preparin' then?
I can hear your voice now, I can feel your presence
Askin' ""Should I rap again?"", You gave me your blessing
The way you spelled it out, there's an L in every lesson
""Boy, you owe it to the world, let your mess become your message""
Shared you with my friends, the Pops they never had
You lived for our fishin' trips, man, I had a dad
Mine taught discipline, mine taught structure
Mine didn't mind when he had to pull a double
Mine worked overtime, smiled through the struggle
'Cause mine wouldn't let us feel what he had to suffer
See, mine made sure he had every base covered
So imagine his pain findin' base in the cupboard
Birds don't sing if the words don't sting
Your last few words in my ear still ring (oh)
You told me that you loved me, it was all in your tone (oh-oh)
""I love my two sons"" was the code to your phone, now you're gone
Oh, and the birds don't sing (no, they don't)
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (don't the truth ruin it?)
Pain (now it feels different, when they doin' it)
The birds don't sing (no, they don't, and they won't)
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (they don't sing, they just screech in pain)
Pain (it's a cycle, they do that ish over and over again)
(Oh) The birds don't sing
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (who realized they screech in pain, oh-oh)
The birds don't sing
The birds don't sing, they screech in pain (oh no, they're comin' back again, oh no)
Remember those who lost their mothers and fathers
And make sure that every single moment that you have with them
You show them love
You show them love
You'll see
